**REMINER II**
This project is the software of the REMINER II.
- W.C.Kim, REMiner-II: A tool for rapid identification and configuration of repetitive element arrays from large mammalian chromosomes as a single query (2012)
- Alignment Generator extracts the raw file of the alignment from the result of REMINER II software (.rem file).

We added some automation code for REMINER II software.
